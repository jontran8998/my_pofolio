### Introduction
This was my most favorite project ever, where I could experiment many complicated techniques in embedded system such as DMA, LCD parallel control, SD card reader. Everything is coded manually even a single pixel. I also implemented an built-in event-based OS, which enhanced pretty much the LCD touch screen performance.
