### Introduction
At the end of 2013, Raspberry Pi started to become popular. At that time, Embedded Linux was a trend. Many students wanted to have their own tiny Linux machine. With my embedded software experience from my part-time job, I decided to build a robot from a combination of Raspberry Pi and STM34F407
